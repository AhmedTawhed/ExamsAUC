# Choice of The System Architecture<br>
### I picked Domain Driven Design because this application is domain-specific and it makes it easier to write cleaner code.
### I have used the Repository Design Pattern, which is a key concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), to abstract the persistence details and provide a clean interface for accessing and persisting domain objects. As it helps me to separate the domain logic from data access concerns, making the code more modular, maintainable, and testable. By using repositories, I can easily switch between different data sources or storage mechanisms without affecting the overall application logic, promoting flexibility and decoupling in my design.

### Note: database backup can be found in the repository.
